22th Nov:

partysip is stable and tested for the SIP side of the application. It
does contains most required features for proxy and registrar. (SRV
record... possiblity to route calls with plugins decisions.)

The weakness of partysip is now concerning the interface with
external applications. The plugin interface (currently very
partially used) does not fit all needs. Plugins, by now, have
to make a decision quickly and they have to provide an answer
as soon as they give the decision. It's not great for accessing
database or doing any blocking calls.

May be a the plugin interfaces should be rewritten.

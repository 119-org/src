partysip is a modular SIP proxy server. This is a central point for managing
a SIP network. Mainly SIP phones advertise their locations (sip urls like
<sip:jack@atosc.org>) to partysip which is then able to route the calls.

-------------- DESCRIPTION --------------
-----------------------------------------

partysip is a modular application where functionalities and behaviors are
defined in plugins. A set of proposed plugins for usual behaviors is included
in the distribution. The filtering plugin will block requests based on a
set of rules. The authentication plugin will be responsible of validating
credentials found in requests. A plugin will be responsible for routing
message properly when the request does already contain routing informations.
Other plugins will generally be used to search for locations in a local or
remote database or through a DNS resolution (SRV records).

You don't have enough?

The useful feature about partysip is that you can build plugins for any
purpose:
 * make accounting.
 * remote control of your house.
 * service redirection.

-----------------------------------------
--------------   PLUGINS   --------------
-----------------------------------------

Plugins are made optional. The set of pre-loaded plugins will entirely be up
to the proxy administrator allowing him to adapt the proxy behavior to its
need.

By now, release 0.5.5 offers 9 plugins.
 * A UDP plugin. Any plugins for other protocol can be implemented (TCP is
   not yet provided).
 * The filter plugin usefull for deefining dialing plan.
 * An authentication plugin (rfc2617) exists for MD5. (Supported by nearly all

   the a local database and dbm file.

   info about local user to route requests.

Compilation process for windows:

Step 1:

Build osipparser2.dll and osip2.dll in multithreaded mode.

I generally use those usefull flags:
 "-DUSE_TMP_BUFFER, -DOSIP_MT -DSYSTEM_LOGGER_ENABLED".




Step 2:

*******    INSTALL THE MICROSOFT PLATFORM SDK    *****

Versions of the SDK older than 2002 will not be enough!




Step 3:

* Open the workspace "plugins.dsw".
* edit the correct include path for ALL workspace
  $path_to_osip\,path_to_partysip\,path_to_partysip\ppl\win32  evrywhere should be ok!
* edit the correct library path to find osipparser2.lib and osip2.lib 
* Add osipparser.dll and osip2.dll in the library's path.
* Build all (ppl, partysip and all plugins)
* Edit and copy the file partysip.conf manually in the directory where
  partysip.exe is build (./windows/.libs) 
* Run inside the .libs directory "partysip.exe -d 6 -i"

Report any failure in this process to <jack@atosc.org>.
